# 🚀 Challenge: Full-Stack with Node, Express, Adonis, and Nuxt

Welcome to the **Full-Stack Challenge** promoted by [*Torne-se um Programador*](https://www.youtube.com/@torneseumprogramador)!

This repository contains code examples and the complete roadmap I am following to learn and apply technologies such as **Node.js**, **Express**, **Adonis.js**, and **Nuxt.js**.

---

## 🎯 Challenge Goal

The main goal of this challenge is to learn the fundamentals of **Full-Stack** development through hands-on practice using modern tools and robust frameworks.
By the end, the objective is to build a complete application and master important concepts like:

* Understanding back-end fundamentals with **Node.js**
* Developing RESTful APIs using **Express**
* Exploring **AdonisJS** as a full-featured back-end framework
* Building web applications with **Nuxt.js** on the front-end, using SSR and SPA
* Applying best practices such as Clean Code, TDD, and Clean Architecture
